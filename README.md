# Simulation study
<i>Project for IMS 2023, FIT VUT</i><br>

## Usage
### Building the Executable
To build the executable, simply run the following command:
```bash
make
```
This command will generate an executable file in the `\bin` directory.

### Generating Documentation
If you want to generate documentation, you can use following command:
```bash
make doc
```
This will generate documentation in `\doc\simulation_study.pdf` and temporary files in `\obj`.

### Cleaning Object Files
To remove the object files, you can use the following command:
```bash
make clean
```
This command will clean up the `\obj` directory.

### Cleaning All Generated Files
If you want to remove both the object files and the generated executable, use the following command:
```bash
make cleanall
```
This will clean both the `\obj` and `\bin` directories and also `\doc\documentation.pdf`.
